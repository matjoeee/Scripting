# Scripting
Some script templates from my homelab &amp; tests. <br>
The scripts in these folders are just templates and do not contain any form of information regarding my setup or whatsoever!

## 1. PowerShell
Here will be some PowerShell scripts that I used in my homelab tests. Since all my servers run on Linux, I rarely use those day-to-day.

## 2. Bash
Here will be some Bash scripts that I actively use in my homelab setup or that I have used in some tests.

## 3. Docker
Here will be some docker-compose files that I also actively use in my homelab setup or that I have used in tests.
