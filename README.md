# Scripting
These are some scripts that might be useful to some people, or myself for I have used them in the past and who knows when I might need them again :)

## 1. Windows
Here will be some PowerShell or Batch scripts that I used in my homelab tests., or that are generally pretty useful for troubleshooting. Since all my servers run on Linux, I rarely use those day-to-day.

## 2. Linux
Here will be some Bash scripts that I actively use in my homelab setup or that I have used in some tests.

## 3. Docker
Here will be some docker-compose files that I also actively use in my homelab setup or that I have used in tests.
